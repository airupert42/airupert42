## Hi there! My name is Aidan!

Currently studying at the wonderful 42 Prague Campus.
C is the current language of choice in order to grasp fundamental principles.
Any work shared will 100% be the best it can possibly be!
I hope to have a strong understanding of essential Dev principles within a year of study.
